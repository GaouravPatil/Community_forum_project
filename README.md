# Community Forum Projects 

# Implement Full Discussion Forum with Real-Time Features

## Pending Steps

1. **Create chat/models.py**: Define Thread and Reply models with fields for title, content, author (User), and timestamps.

2. **Create chat/forms.py**: Define ThreadForm and ReplyForm for handling user input.

3. **Create chat/views.py**: Implement index view to render the forum, and AJAX views for creating threads and replies.

4. **Create chat/urls.py**: Define URL patterns for the chat app (index, create-thread, create-reply).

5. **Update project/urls.py**: Include the chat app URLs under /chat/.

6. **Update project/settings.py**: Add 'channels' to INSTALLED_APPS, set ASGI_APPLICATION, and configure CHANNEL_LAYERS (InMemory for dev).

7. **Create chat/consumers.py**: Implement ChatConsumer for WebSocket handling (connect, disconnect, receive messages for new threads/replies).

8. **Create chat/routing.py**: Define WebSocket URL patterns for /ws/chat/.

9. **Update project/asgi.py**: Integrate ProtocolTypeRouter for WebSockets using chat.routing.

10. **Update requirements.txt**: Add channels dependency.

11. **Install dependencies**: Run `pip install channels`.

12. **Run migrations**: `python manage.py makemigrations chat` and `python manage.py migrate`.

13. **Restart Django server**: Stop current server (Ctrl+C) and run `python manage.py runserver`.

14. **Test the implementation**: 
    - Browse to http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat/ to verify rendering and basic functionality.
    - Test creating threads/replies via forms.
    - Verify real-time updates via WebSocket (open multiple tabs, create post in one, see update in another).
    - Check search and other JS features.
